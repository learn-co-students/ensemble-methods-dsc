# ensemble-methods-dsc

In this section we will be covering Ensemble methods as a whole and dig deeper into Random Forest. Additional resources are provided for the student to explore boosting at their own pace.

## Learning objectives

By the end of the session students should be able to:
* [ ] Define ensemble methods
* [ ] List the 3 main categories of Ensemble methods
* [ ] Compare the main categories of Ensemble methods
* [ ] Explain how each method is likely to increase/decrease the model's performance and likelihood to overfit
* [ ] Fit a RandomForest learner
* [ ] Inspect individual estimators in a RandomForest model
